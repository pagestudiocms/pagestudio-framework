# Pagestudio Framework

The PageStudio Framework offers a system (or framework) for concurrent development of two or more applications within the same repository. In this context, each independent application is denoted as a "child" application. Each child application has a front controller denoted as a "child" front controller. The primary front controller, denoted as the "main" front controller, acts as the central entry point to these child applications. It provides an interface to the framework's kernel, enabling the definition of routes. These routes play a crucial role in facilitating communication between the main front controller and the various child applications.

## When to use this framework?

Implement this framework when dealing with smaller applications that are too substantial and diverse to be categorized as modules of the same application, yet not substantial enough to be treated as standalone applications. This framework also proves beneficial during the migration process from one application to another. For instance, when transitioning from CodeIgniter v2 or v3 applications to CodeIgniter v4, or when moving to an entirely different framework.
