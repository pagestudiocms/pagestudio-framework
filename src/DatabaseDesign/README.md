## Adapter

The database adapter is a bridge between the virtual member manager profile and schema managers and the underlying database. The adapter looks up the data source and updates or queries the database using SQL queries. 

A database adapter is an implementation of a database connector. The connector is more at the conceptual level, while the adapter is at the implementation level, though they refer to the same thing.

Database drivers, programs that translate the Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) or JDBC calls to DBMS-specific calls, are used to link the application to any one of several databases that could be used as the data source. ODBC is a programming interface for accessing database systems.
